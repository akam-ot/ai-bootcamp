# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
Analysis of the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning.

## Method
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Created features from passenger names, family info, and ticket data
- Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models

## Results
- Random Forest performed best: 83.2% accuracy
- Strong performance in identifying both survivors and non-survivors
- Final model using 200 trees achieved 83.3% cross-validation score
